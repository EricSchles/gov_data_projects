#Working for the Man

Working without a profit motive allows for a lot of great things to happen:

* a consistent 40 hour work week, no matter what
* engineers are coaxed by management to take all their vacation time
* We can pioneer new modes or working
* a culture of learning
* what we do has an impact
* 80% of the time is spent on projects for 18F, 20% on projects for you

Other things I'll mention:
* Data Science 18F

##18F is fully distributed

At 18F we believe in having the best talent.  That means not forcing someone to move. All our meetings are fully distributed.  We use slack heavily.     

##How 18F learns together

* Teach Python - we run a class where non-programmers at 18F are able to take time out of their work day to learn to program.  Classes are taught by seasoned by python programmers.
	* Classes are taught via google hangout.  
	* We use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
	* We are using [dive into python](http://diveintopython3.net/)

* Individualized Mentorship - 18Fers mentor each other in their areas of relative strength or weakness.  So for example, I am mentoring one of our backend engineers in machine learning. And one of our designers is mentoring me!  Anyone can be mentored by anyone else.

* Working groups that:
	* meet regularly ~ once every 2 weeks
	* provide support for folks looking to learn, via answering questions on slack
	* collaborating on side projects

##Having an impact

Examples of things we've built:

* [https://cloud.gov/](https://cloud.gov/)
* [https://beta.fec.gov/](https://beta.fec.gov/)
* [https://analytics.usa.gov/](https://analytics.usa.gov/)  
* [https://pulse.cio.gov/](https://pulse.cio.gov/) 
* [https://calc.gsa.gov/](https://calc.gsa.gov/)
* [https://www.uscis.gov/](https://www.uscis.gov/)

##Projects I've built as part of the 80 - 20 rule

* [https://github.com/18F/share](https://share.app.cloud.gov) - ~/Documents/projects/file_transfer_js/file_transfer_peer_to_peer (push to cloud.gov)
* [https://github.com/EricSchles/document_search](https://github.com/EricSchles/document_search)
* skills database - currently in prototype

##Data Science at 18F

The data science working group at 18F - a support center for burgoening data scientists at 18F.  We talk about projects, tools, techniques and give technical help to the larger 18F community.

Data Science I've personally done for projects:
* [dedupe examples](https://github.com/EricSchles/dedupe_examples)
* [RQ scheduler](https://github.com/EricSchles/simple_rq_scheduler)
* [time series analysis](https://github.com/18F/calc/blob/data_analysis/data_analysis/timeseries_analysis_of_prices.py)
* prototyping a cluster computing platform for cloud.gov - https://github.com/trustedanalytics and http://trustedanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TAP-_Overview_100516.pdf
