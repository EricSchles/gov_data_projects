#Working for the Man

Working without a profit motive allows for a lot of great things to happen:

* a consistent 40 hour work week, no matter what
* engineers are coaxed by management to take all their vacation time
* We can pioneer new modes or working
* a culture of learning
* what we do has an impact
* 80% of the time is spent on projects for 18F, 20% on projects for you

Other things I'll mention:
* Data Science 18F

##18F is fully distributed

At 18F we believe in having the best talent.  That means not forcing someone to move.  

##How 18F learns together

* Teach Python - we run a class where non-programmers at 18F are able to take time out of their work day to learn to program.  Classes are taught by seasoned by python programmers.
	* Classes are taught via google hangout.  
	* We use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
	* We are using [dive into python](http://diveintopython3.net/)

* Individualized Mentorship - 18Fers mentor each other in their areas of relative strength or weakness.  So for example, I am mentoring one of our backend engineers in machine learning. And one of our designers is mentoring me!  Anyone can be mentored by anyone else.

* Working groups that:
	* meet regularly ~ once every 2 weeks
	* provide support for folks looking to learn, via answering questions on slack
	* collaborating on side projects
